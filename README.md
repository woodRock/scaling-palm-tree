# scaling-palm-tree
A command-line interface (CLI) for bus timetables in Wellington, New Zealand.

## Install Rust 

Rust can be installed on a Linux platform using the following command. 

```bash 
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Example 

When we run the client, we give the stop id and service number as arguments. 

```bash
# cargo run <stop_id> <service_number>
$ cargo run 5510 1
