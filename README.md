# Metlink Departure Boards (CLI)
[![Rust](https://github.com/woodRock/scaling-palm-tree/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/woodRock/scaling-palm-tree/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A command line interface (CLI) to display departure boards for buses in Wellington, New Zealand. This make an HTTP request to the [Metlink API](https://opendata.metlink.org.nz/) to retrieve times. The CLI filters the departure board for a stop by service, and supports cancellations, wheelchair access.

## Example 

Here is an example output given from the CLI. 

```
1    Island Bay      9min
1    Island Bay      9min    â™¿
1    Island Bay      CAN
1    Island Bay      08:17AM
1    Island Bay      08:32AM
1    Island Bay      08:47AM
1    Island Bay      09:04AM
1    Island Bay      09:17AM
1    Island Bay      09:32AM
1    Island Bay      09:49AM
1    Island Bay      10:04AM
1    Island Bay      10:19AM

## Usage

When we run the client, we give the `stop_id` and `service_id` as arguments, with optional argument `limit`. 

```bash
# cargo run <stop_id> <service_id> [limit]
$ cargo run 5510 1 5;
```

### stop_id 

We can find the `stop_id` on the Metlink website (https://www.metlink.org.nz/), simply find you desired stop, click on it, and the 4 digit number correspnds to the `stop_id`, e.g. "Stop 5510 Willis Street at Willbank Court" has the `stop_id` of 5510.

### service_id 

The `service_id` is the number of the bus, e.g. the "1 - Island Bay" has the `service_id` of 1. 

### limit 

The `limit` is an optional argument, where the user can specify the number of departures to display. Given in chronological order showing the nearest services first. If the `limit` is not specified, all departures returned by the API call are shown. E.g. the command above with `limit` of 5 will only show the next 5 departures.

## Bash API call

This bash script gives the API call to the Metlink API for reference. 

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api.opendata.metlink.org.nz/v1/stop-predictions?stop_id=<stop_id>" -H "accept: application/json" -H "x-api-key: <api-key>"
```

## Install Rust 

You need rust installed on your machine in order to run the development environment. Rust can be installed on a Linux platform using the following command. 

```bash 
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
