# Metlink Departure Boards (CLI)
[![Rust](https://github.com/woodRock/scaling-palm-tree/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/woodRock/scaling-palm-tree/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A command line interface (CLI) to display departure boards for buses in Wellington, New Zealand. This make an HTTP request to the Metlink API (https://opendata.metlink.org.nz/) to retrieve times. The CLI filters the departure board for a stop by service, and supports cancellations, wheelchair access.

## Example 

Here is an example output given from the CLI. 

```
1    Island Bay      9min
1    Island Bay      9min    â™¿
1    Island Bay      CAN
1    Island Bay      08:17AM
1    Island Bay      08:32AM
1    Island Bay      08:47AM
1    Island Bay      09:04AM
1    Island Bay      09:17AM
1    Island Bay      09:32AM
1    Island Bay      09:49AM
1    Island Bay      10:04AM
1    Island Bay      10:19AM
1    Island Bay      10:34AM

## Usage

When we run the client, we give the `stop_id` and `service_id` as arguments. 

```bash
# cargo run <stop_id> <service_id>
$ cargo run 5510 1 
```

### stop_id 

We can find the `stop_id` on the Metlink website (https://www.metlink.org.nz/), simply find you desired stop, click on it, and the 4 digit number correspnds to the `stop_id`, e.g. "Stop 5510 Willis Street at Willbank Court" has the `stop_id` of 5510.

### service_id 

The `service_id` is the number of the bus, e.g. the "1 - Island Bay" has the `service_id` of 1.
